# Atmega32_PWM_generation_and_measurement
Runtime variable PWM generation using timer1 in fast PWM mode and PWM measurement enabling ICU in timer1
timer0 is used for periodic ADC measurement to update the duty cycle for the generated PWM
lcd is used by the measurement microcontroller to display measured PWM frequency and duty cycle
